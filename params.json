This project has been a playground for me as I work through the various Camel concepts, and while many of the examples are similar to what you will see in the book, there are a couple noteworthy differences.\r\n\r\n1. I like XML as much as the next guy, but I like Java better. All of my routes are written using Camel's Java DSL. I've found it to be easier to debug and test.\r\n2. Camel In Action covers testing about two thirds of the way through the book, which means there are no tests for the code that they write up until that point. I enjoy Test Driven Development and practice it at home and work, so while I was working through each example, I started with tests. As of right now, I have not started using Camel's test code module, but this project will eventually be cut over to it (some glorious day).\r\n3. Spring is my friend. Camel integrates heavily with Spring, and that means that I can use all of my favorite Spring things while writing routes including bean generation, auto-wiring, and property injection. \r\n\r\n#Branches\r\nThere are a couple of different branches to this project, depending on what you are into.\r\n* [Simple Route](https://github.com/kingOburgers/camel-ride/tree/simple-route) - An introductory point for Camel, Java, and Spring.\r\n* [Master](https://github.com/kingOburgers/camel-ride/tree/master) - This branch contains an example of several of the different Enterprise Integration Patterns that Camel was created for.
