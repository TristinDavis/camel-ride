        <h3>Camel Ride</h3>

<p>Everyone has to start somewhere, for me, it was with Manning's <a href="http://www.manning.com/ibsen/">Camel In Action</a> by Claus Ibsen and Jonathan Strakey. This project has been a playground for me as I work through the various Camel concepts, and while many of the examples are similar to what you will see in the book, there are a couple noteworthy differences.</p>

<ol>
<li>I like XML as much as the next guy, but I like Java better. All of my routes are written using Camel's Java DSL. I've found it to be easier to debug and test.</li>
<li>Camel In Action covers testing about two thirds of the way through the book, which means there are no tests for the code that they write up until that point. I enjoy Test Driven Development and practice it at home and work, so while I was working through each example, I started with tests. As of right now, I have not started using Camel's test code module, but this project will eventually be cut over to it (some glorious day).</li>
<li>Spring is my friend. Camel integrates heavily with Spring, and that means that I can use all of my favorite Spring things while writing routes including bean generation, auto-wiring, and property injection. </li>
</ol><h1>Branches</h1>

<p>There are a couple of different branches to this project, depending on what you are into.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/kingOburgers/camel-ride/tree/simple-route">Simple Route</a> - An introductory point for Camel, Java, and Spring.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/kingOburgers/camel-ride/tree/master">Master</a> - This branch contains an example of several of the different Enterprise Integration Patterns that Camel was created for. Check out the README for more information. </li>
